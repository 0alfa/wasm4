# Further Ideas

There are certainly a lot of possible aspects to improve upon. Like: Did you notice you can - if you're fast enough - make a 180Â° turn? Even though you blocked the easy one, this can still happen.

Or what about the fact, that the fruit can spawn *inside* the snake? Another place you can improve the game. Also: Different levels with walls or maybe different kind of food to eat. Or make the usable screen wider than the visible one. There are *plenty* of options to take on this simple game. Good luck!

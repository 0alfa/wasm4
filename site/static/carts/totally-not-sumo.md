# Totally not sumo

"Totally Not Sumo" is definitively not a sumo game, but it's a game where you need to push your opponents out, while dealing with an controller duality.

This game can be played locally and online using the [netplay feature](https://wasm4.org/docs/guides/multiplayer#netplay).

## Controls (local multiplayer)

* Player 1: Arrows and M
* Player 2: ESDF and Tab

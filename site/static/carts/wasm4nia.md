# wasm4nia

[wasm4nia](https://ramse.se/wasm4nia) was originally created for the [WASM-4 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/wasm4) in January of 2022.

See [here](https://ramse.se/wasm4nia) for more details and updates.

## Input

When playing on keyboard, WASM-4 uses **X to confirm** and **Z to back**.

**To exit out of a song**, you can press all directions and 1 and 2 (meaning all 6 buttons). R also works to restart back to the main menu.

For starting out, I strongly recommend these settings:

## Chart modes

There are two different chart modes which change how the charts are generated:

**4-Key**: Meant for playing with four fingers, using two from each hand. For this mode I recommend using the **[Z][X][Down][Right]** layout.

**Index**: Meant for playing using only your two index fingers on the arrow keys. For this mode I recommend using the **[Left][Down][Up][Right]** layout.

## Audio offset

If you get a lot of EARLY or LATE when you feel that you are timing correctly, nudge the Audio Offset setting a couple of steps.
Note that this setting counts in frames, so you don't need to change it by a lot. **-2** works well for me.

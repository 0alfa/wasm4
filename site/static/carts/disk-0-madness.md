# disk-0 MADNESS

A submission to the [WASM-4 Game Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/wasm4-v2).

Original page on [itch.io](https://maxcurzi.itch.io/disk-0-madness).

## Objective
__Avoid enemies that have a different color than yours and absorb the ones with the same color as yours.__

Trigger bombs to switch the enemies' color to yours!

Survive as long as possible.
The game gets harder the longer you play, and the music adapts to the difficulty.
You can gain a first extra life at 100.000 points, and more with more points :)

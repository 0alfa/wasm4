# Journey to Entorus

*Prepare to die! You must make your way to Entorus, and maybe even make it back.*

This is a bullet-hell with a short story, made for [the second WASM-4 gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/wasm4-v2).

With default controls, you use **arrow keys to move around**, and **Z and X to control your ship**.

The game is a bit difficult at times, so if you are getting frustrated, you can turn on **Practice Mode** in Options to just enjoy the ride.

Note that the **Extra Story** is an optional challenge created for those that are looking for something more difficult.

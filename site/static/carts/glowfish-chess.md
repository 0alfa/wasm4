# Glowfish Chess

A simple chess implementation. Can be played against another player (Player 2) or against a simple CPU player.
Glowfish uses a significantly stripped down version of [`cozy-chess`](https://github.com/analog-hors/cozy-chess).
I wrote this because I thought it would be funny to fit `cozy-chess` into a wasm4 executable, as it is not designed for code size.

[Source code available here.](https://github.com/analog-hors/glowfish)

## Controls
- D-pad to move the cursor and change the selected menu item

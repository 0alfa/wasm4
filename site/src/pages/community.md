## Roadmap

Here are WASM-4's goals for the future:

- Support bundling of native Windows/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS applications.
- Add a pause button and options menu to the emulator.
- First-class support for new languages: [Swift](https://swiftwasm.org/),
  [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).
- Support importing and playing music from [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co).
- Improve responsiveness of the virtual gamepad on mobile.

## Credits

WASM-4 was started by [Bruno Garcia](https://aduros.com).

It was very much inspired by [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and other fantasy
consoles.
